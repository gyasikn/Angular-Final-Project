`This is a mobile friendly application that I built for Module 3 of Ironhack. It is a platform where users can create and save food recipes and add a list of ingredients to that specific recipe. Those ingredients can then be passed onto your personal shopping cart where you can shop for those items and recreate your favorite recipes. More features to come in the future.`
